# Rapid-Login

The best login and profile page on the internet. Make sure to download json-server via `npm-install -g json-server`. 

You can then run the json-server with `json-server --watch db.json`. 

After, you can either run npm start, or point your nginx/apache2 config to login/build. Make sure to run json-server first on port 3000 since that's the api
we call. 

You can login with miki, sarit, nofar, rafi or bear with password 123456. Enjoy and let me know if you have any questions!
